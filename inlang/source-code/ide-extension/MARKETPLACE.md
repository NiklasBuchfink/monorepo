<br />

Supercharge i18n within VS Code with powerful tools designed to streamline the translation process. Visualize, edit, and lint translated strings effortlessly using Inline Decorations & Hover Support. Extract new strings with a simple click, making localization tasks more intuitive and efficient.

[Inlang](https://inlang.com) is a powerful [open-source](https://github.com/inlang/monorepo/tree/main/inlang/source-code/ide-extension) extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting started

### 1. Create a `project.inlang.json` in the **root** of your project

You can use the following template when using json files as translation files, if not, please look for other [supported resource file types](https://inlang.com/):

```json
{
	// official schema ensures that your project file is valid
	"$schema": "https://inlang.com/schema/project-settings",
	// the "source" language tag that is used in your project
	"sourceLanguageTag": "en",
	// all the language tags you want to support in your project
	"languageTags": ["en", "de"],
	"modules": [
		"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@inlang/plugin-json@4/dist/index.js"
	], // or use another storage module: https://inlang.com/c/plugins (i18next, json, inlang message format)
	"settings": {}
}
```

### 2. Decide on a **syntax matcher**

You should continue with **installing a syntax matcher**. There are multiple syntax matcher available like:

- m function matcher: https://inlang.com/m/632iow21/plugin-inlang-mFunctionMatcher
- t function matcher: https://inlang.com/m/698iow33/plugin-inlang-tFunctionMatcher
- *if you are using the i18next module, everything is already built-in*

### 3. ✨ Recommended

If you want to add lint rules to your experience, you can add them from: https://inlang.com/c/lint-rules

#### Requirements:

- VS Code version 1.84.0 or higher.
- Node.js version v18 or higher.

### Context Tooltips

See translations and edit them directly in your code. No more back-and-forth looking into the translation files themselves.

### Extract Messages (translations)

Extract Messages (translations) via the `Inlang: Extract Message` code action.

### Message Linting

Get notified about missing translations and other issues directly in your IDE.

### Inline Annotations

See translations directly in your code. No more back-and-forth looking into the translation files themselves.

### Update Translations

Translations from the resource files are automatically updated when you change the source text.

## Usage

Just _highlight/select_ the text you want and hit `cmd .` or `ctrl +` (Quick Fix / Yellow Bulb) to open the **translate dialog** to provide a id for it.

Hover over the message to see the tooltip with the translation.

## Configuration

You can configure the extension to your needs by defining the `ideExtension` property in the config.

| Property                   | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messageReferenceMatchers` | `Array` | An array of functions that define matchers for message references inside the code. Each function takes an argument of type `{ documentText: string }` and returns a promise that resolves to an array of message references (as defined by the `messageReferenceSchema`).                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `extractMessageOptions`    | `Array` | An array of objects that define options for extracting messages. Each object has a property `callback` that is a function which is called when the user finishes the message extraction command. The `callback` function takes two arguments of type `string`: `messageId` (the message identifier entered by the user) and `selection` (the text which was extracted), and returns a `string` that represents the code which should be inserted into the document. |
| `documentSelectors`        | `Array` | An array of [VS Code DocumentSelectors](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/document-selector) that specify for which files/programming languages the extension should be activated. Each document selector is an object with optional properties `language`, `scheme`, `pattern`, and `notebookType`.                                                                                                                                                     |

For this example, the extension parses strings with a `t` translation function & gives the according extract options `{t("messageID")}` & `t("messageID")`.
You can fully customize this behavior.
