# Getting Started

Get started instantly with the Paraglide-Next CLI.

```bash
npx @inlang/paraglide-next init
npm install
```

The CLI will ask you which languages you want to support. This can be changed later. 

It will:
- Create an [Inlang Project](https://inlang.com/documentation/concept/project)
- Create translation files for each of your languages
- Add necessary Provider Components and files 
- Update your `next.config.js` file to use the Paraglide-Next Plugin.
- Offer to automatically migrate to the [Localized navigation APIs](#localized-navigation-apis) if you're using the App Router (recommended)

You can now start your development server and visit `/de`, `/ar`, or whatever languages you've set up.

## Creating and Using Messages

Your messages live in `messages/{languageTag}.json` files. You can add messages in these files as key-value pairs of the message ID and the translations.

Use curly braces to add parameters.

```json
// messages/en.json
{
	// The $schema key is automatically ignored
	"$schema": "https://inlang.com/schema/inlang-message-format",

	"hello_world" : "Hello World!",
	"greetings": "Greetings {name}."
}
```

Learn more about the format in the [Inlang Message Format Documentation](https://inlang.com/m/reootnfj/plugin-inlang-messageFormat).

##Â Using Messages in Code

Use messages by importing them from `@/paraglide/messages.js`. By convention, we do a wildcard import as `m`.

```tsx
import * as m from "@/paraglide/messages.js"

export function Home() {
	return (
		<>
			<h1>{m.homepage_title()}</h1>
			<p>{m.homepage_subtitle({ some: "param" })}</p>
		</>
	)
}
```

Only messages used in client components are sent to the client. Messages in Server Components don't impact bundle size.

## Localized navigation APIs

> If you're using the pages router this section does not apply to you. You are are using [Next's built-in i18n routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing). 

You can now visit `/de/some-page` but you still need to add the language prefix to every single link. Wouldn't it be nice if that happened automatically? 

For this, Paraglide-Next provides Localised Navigation APIs, exported from `@/lib/i18n.js`.

To get localized `<Link>`s you need to replace the ones from `next/link` with the ones from `@/lib/i18n.js`. Just find & replace the imports.

```diff
- import Link from "next/link"
+ import { Link } from "@/lib/i18n"Â 

// This now links to /de/about depending on the current language
<Link href="/about"> 
```

You can do the same for the other navigation APIs.

```diff
- import { usePathname, useRouter, redirect, permanentRedirect} from "next/navigation"
+ import { usePathname, useRouter, redirect, permanentRedirect} from "@/lib/i18n"
```

If you opted in to Localised Navigation during the `init` command this import replacement will have happened automatically.

## Advanced Usage

### Translated Metadata

To return different metadata for each language, we will need to use `generateMetadata`.

```ts
export async function generateMetadata() {
	return {
		title: m.home_metadata_title(),
		description: m.home_metadata_description(),
	}
}
```

> If you were to use `export const metadata` your metadata would always end up in the source language.

### Linking to Pages in Specific Languages

If you want a Link to be in a specific language you can use the `locale` prop.

```tsx
<Link href="/about" locale="de">
```

This is convenient for constructing language switchers.

If you are using `router.push` to navigate you can pass `locale` as an option.

```ts
function Component() {
	const router = useRouter()
	return (
		<button onClick={() => router.push("/about", { locale: "de" })}>Go to German About page</button>
	)
}
```

### Excluding certain Routes from Localised Routing

You can exclude certain routes from i18n using the `exclude` option on `createI18n` in `lib/i18n`. You can either pass a string or a regex.

```ts
// src/lib/i18n.js
export const { ... } =
	createI18n<AvailableLanguageTag>({
		 //array of routes to exclude
		exclude: [
			/^\/api(\/.*)?$/ //excludes all routes starting with /api
			"/admin" //excludes /admin, but not /admin/anything - globs are not supported
		],
	})
```

Excluded routes won't be prefixed with the language tag & the middleware will not add `Link` headers to them.

> Tip: LLMs are really good at writing regexes.

### Setting the Language in Server Actions

Use the `initializeLanguage` function at the top of your server-action file to make sure the language is available.

```ts
// src/app/actions.ts
"use server";
import { initializeLanguage } from "@inlang/paraglide-next"
import { languageTag } from "@/paraglide/runtime"

initializeLanguage() //call it at the top of the file

export async function someAction() {
	languageTag() // "de"
}
```

### Changing the default language

By default, the default language is the `sourceLanguageTag` defined in `project.inlang/settings.json`. You can change it with the `defaultLanguage` option.

```ts
export const { ... } =
	createI18n<AvailableLanguageTag>({
		defaultLanguage: "de"
	})
```

### How language-detection works

Paraglide-Next follows these steps to determine the language.

- First, it will try to determine the language based on the URL.
- If that fails, it will look for a `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie.
- If that isn't available either, it will try to negotiate the language based on the `Accept-Language` header.
- Finally, it will fall back to the default language.

If a language has been determined once, it will set the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie so that future ambiguities don't result in random language switches.

### Translated Pathnames

You can use different pathnames for each language with the `pathname` option.
Pathnames should not include a language prefix or the base path.

```ts
export const { ... } =
	createI18n<AvailableLanguageTag>({
		pathname: {
			"/about": {
				en: "/about",
				de: "/ueber-uns"
			}
		}
	})
```
 
You can use parameters in pathnames with square brackets. You have to use an identical set of parameters in both the canonical and translated pathnames.

You can use double-square brackets for optional parameters and the spread operator to make it a match-all parameter.

```ts
pathname: {
	"/articles/[slug]": {
		en: "/articles/[slug]",
		de: "/artikel/[slug]"
	},
	"/admin/[...rest]": {
		en: "/administration/[...rest]",
		de: "/admin/[...rest]"
	},
}
```

You can also use a message as a pathname. The translation will be used as the pathname. You can use parameters here too. 

```json
// messages/en.json
{
	"about_pathname": "/about"
}
// messages/de.json
{
	"about_pathname": "/ueber-uns"
}
```

```ts
export const { ... } =
	createI18n<AvailableLanguageTag>({
		pathname: {
			"/about": m.about_pathname //pass as reference
		}
	})
```

Be careful when using translated pathnames in combination with `prefix: "never"`. Links may not work if they are shared between people with different languages.

## Getting a localized Pathname

There are situations where you need to know the localized version of a pathname. You can use the `localizePathname` function for that.

```ts
import { localizePathname } from "@/lib/i18n"
localizePathname("/about", "de") // de/ueber-uns
```

This does not include the `basePath`.

### Alternate Links

Search engines like Google expect you to tell them about translated versions of your pages. Paraglide-Next does this by default by adding the `Link` Header to requests.

You **don't** need to add the translated versions of your site to your sitemap, although it doesn't hurt if you do.

### Right-to-Left Support

Define a map of all languages to their text-direction & index into it.

```tsx
import { languageTag, type AvailableLanguageTag } from "@/paraglide/runtime.js"

// This is fully type-safe & forces you to keep it up-to-date
const direction: Record<AvailableLanguageTag, "rtl" | "ltr"> = {
	en: "ltr",
	ar: "rtl",
}

// src/app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
	return (
		<LanguageProvider>
			<html lang={languageTag()} dir={direction[languageTag()]}>
	//...
```

> We discourage using the `Intl.Locale` API for text-direction as it's still poorly supported

### Chaining Middleware

You can chain `paraglide-next`'s middleware with your own by calling it inside your own middleware function. You need to pass it the request and use the returned response.

```ts
// src/middleware.ts
import { middleware as paraglide } from "@/lib/i18n"
export default function middleware(request: NextRequest) {

	//do something with the request

	const response = paraglide(request)

	// do something with the response
	return response
}
```

## (Legacy)Â Setup With the Pages Router

The `paraglide-next init` command will have set up [Next's built-in i18n routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing). Thus, NextJS will automatically prefix all routes with the locale. 

For example, the route `/about` will become `/en/about` for the English locale and `/de/about` for the German locale. Only the default locale won't be prefixed. 

## Known Limitations

There are some known limitations with Paraglide-Next.

- `output: static` isn't supported yet.
- Evaluating messages in module scope always renders the source language.

## Roadmap to 1.0

- Static Export support
- Simplify Setup
- More flexible Routing Strategies
