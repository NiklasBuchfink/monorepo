## What is inlang?

Inlang is an ecosystem of interoperable [lix apps](https://github.com/opral/monorepo/tree/main/lix) to globalize software. 

Every app in the inlang ecosystem shares the same review, automation, and collaboration layer, making cross-team collaboration possible. No syncing, hand-offs, or automation barriers.

#### Example apps

- [Paraglide.js](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs) to have a fully translated, typesafe & fast app in minutes
- [Sherlock](https://inlang.com/m/r7kp499g/app-inlang-ideExtension) to translate your app right in the editor
- [Fink](https://inlang.com/m/tdozzpar/app-inlang-finkLocalizationEditor) to translate your app in the browser & invite collaborators to help you
- [Parrot](https://inlang.com/m/gkrpgoir/app-parrot-figmaPlugin) see translations directly in Figma
- [inlang CLI](https://inlang.com/m/2qj2w8pu/app-inlang-cli) to lint your messsages with lint rules or machine translate them & have quality control in CI/CD
- *build your own app / plugin / lint rule* with the [inlang SDK](https://inlang.com/documentation)
- ...


## Why inlang?

Globalizing software is a cross-team effort that involves ensuring compliance, adapting the design, handling different currencies, managing translations, writing different marketing copy, etc.

Existing point solutions such as apps to manage translations (Lokalise, Weglot, Smartling), apps to manage design copy (ditto, translator), or i18n libraries for developers (next-intl, i18next) don’t have interop between each other. 

The lack of interop of existing solutions leads every app and team to have its own collaboration layer, review system, and automation capabilities. Cross-team collaboration and automation, which are required to globalize software, are difficult to impossible.
